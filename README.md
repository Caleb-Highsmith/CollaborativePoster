# CollaborativePoster

This is an experiment to work on a collaborative CS Club poster.

The poster will be divided up into sections, and each person can create a "Manipulator" to modify their section of the image, collectively coming together as a poster.

### How to use

Running the PosterMain class will open a simple GUI to test every Manipulator. To add your own, simply add a class which extends the abstract Manipulator, and place your file in the src/manipulators directory. It will be automatically detected and show up in the dropdown when you run PosterMain.

I will update this README as more features are added.
